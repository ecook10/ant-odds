# Ant Racing Odds

_a React coding challenge for an interview_

## How to Run
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
navigate to `localhost:3000`

## Next Steps
as always, i could tweak this for forever but i think that i've spent the right amount of time on this - if i were to keep working on this, i would complete the following ...  
* pull in jest + write a few nice unit tests, especially that the `race-content` component is displaying the correct sorted ant + odds data for all race statuses
* test on various screen sizes + adjust the sizing (either by using tailwind or some simple media css queries)
* tweak some of the styles - specifically i think some borders around the ants could be nice, a better color scheme could be implemented, and maybe color the participant components differently based on the ant data)
